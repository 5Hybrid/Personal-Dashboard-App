// Mirrors the hardcoded fallbacks in src-tauri/src/notifications.rs's get_pref()
// calls. The Rust scheduler applies these same defaults when a preference row
// doesn't exist yet, so a freshly-installed app behaves sensibly with no
// Settings interaction at all — this file just needs to agree with Rust's
// constants, not replace them.
